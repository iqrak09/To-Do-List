Project Description

Objective: The goal of this project is to create a simple web-based to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will help students practice front-end web development skills and gain experience in building interactive web applications.
Project Description: In this assignment, you will design and implement a to-do list application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The application should provide a user-friendly interface and should be responsive to different screen sizes.

Requirements:-
User Interface:
● Create a visually appealing user interface for the to-do list. You can use HTML and
CSS to design the layout and styling.
● Include a section where users can input a new task.
● Display the list of tasks with checkboxes to mark them as completed.
● Add options to edit and delete tasks.
Functionality:
● Users should be able to add new tasks by entering text and pressing a "Add"
button.
● Each task should have an option to mark it as completed or incomplete by
checking/unchecking a checkbox.
● Provide an option to edit the task description.
● Allow users to delete tasks they no longer need.
Validation:
● Implement basic validation to ensure that users cannot add empty tasks.
● Handle any potential errors gracefully and provide clear feedback to users.
Local Storage:
● Use JavaScript to store the to-do list data in the browser's local storage so that
tasks persist even if the user refreshes the page.
Responsive Design:
● Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and
mobile devices. Use CSS media queries for responsiveness.
Additional Features (Optional):
● Consider adding features like task prioritization, due dates, or task categories if
you want to challenge yourself further.
