# To-Do-List
A to-do list is a tool used to manage tasks and organize one's time effectively. It typically consists of a list of tasks or activities that need to be completed, along with deadlines or priorities assigned to each task. To-do lists can be handwritten or digital, with many apps and software available for creating and managing them.
